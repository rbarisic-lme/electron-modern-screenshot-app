Thanks for your interest **Modern Screenshots (MS)**! This App strives to supply (currently only Windows) users with better management for screenshots.

**MS** supports up-to 4 Screens at the same time. If you need support for more screens, please contact me via the project's [Github Issues](https://github.com/rbarisic-lme/electron-modern-screenshot-app/issues).

### Quick Start

Take Screenshot:
`STRG+SHIFT+PRINT`

You will hear a "click" sound indicating that the Screenshot (or multiple ones if you have more display screen) has been taken.
The following menu will show after taking a screenshot:

This menu enables you to *Edit*, *Copy*, or *Save* each screen. Just hover your mouse over a screenshot and the context-menu will appear.
When done with the screenshots, you can press the *Close* button.
